      "	After some deep research in the most common watch forums, like WatchUSeek or TimeZone, no solid information \
        can be found regarding the origins and history of the Omodox watch brand. \n \n" +
      "Omodox seems to be a Swiss-based watch brand, assembling watches between the mid-1940s until mid-1970s.\n " +
      "By searching for the company name owners, the brand was officially registered in 1946 by his founder Uhrwerke Lengnau and, in 1986, \
        the brand was sold to Delma Watch Ltd, ceasing to exist. \n \n" +
      "As other brands, Omodox models were mostly entry-level watches and mostly sold in France, Spain and Portugal as affordable timepieces. ",
