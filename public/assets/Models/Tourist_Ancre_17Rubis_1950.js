      "After some deep research in the most common watch forums, like WatchUSeek or TimeZone, no solid information can be found regarding the origins and history of the Tourist watch brand.\n \n" +
      "Tourist seems to be a private lable Swiss-based watch brand. Based on the style of the found watches, the brand assembled watches between the 1950s late-1970s. \n \n" +
      "As other brands, Tourist models were mostly entry-level watches and sold in France, Spain and Portugal as affordable timepieces.",
