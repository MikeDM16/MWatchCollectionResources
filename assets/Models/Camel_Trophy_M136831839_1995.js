    Description: {
        text: "Camel Trophy Watches presents itself as a currently pursued and relatively collectable brand. \n" +
            "Their first watches dates back to around 1986, when the design of the Camel Trophy Adventure Watches began. \
                    Firstly, they were only used as gifts to the participants of the Camel Trophy Rally. \
                    This annual event was held by the cigarettes brand Camel and arrange between 1980 and 2000. \n \n" +

            "Only around 1990, the brand started selling the watches onto the open market, being sold as mid-range watches. \
                    The Camel Trophy watch range seemed to vary slightly from country to country and the design/manufacture of these firsts watches is very unclear. \n \n" +

            "The price of the watches was in (+/- 1991) the middle to low range with the Multichrono costing between 180- 240EUR. \
                    The Superchrono was priced at around 320EUR (and up) and the cheaper Green belt range was around DM 110. \
                    The team Professional LE cost DM 460-510EUR. \n" +
            "Although the sales strategy of the Camel Trophy watches were inconsistent throughout Europe, the watches managed to set a solid impression, \
                    especially in Italy and Spain, when in 1994 the Camel Trophy watches were the 6th best selling watch in Spain. \
                    These watches were associated to quality and extreme resistance and durability. \n \n" +

            "The Swiss watch giant Mondaine took over all licensing rights for Camel Trophy Adventure Watches in 1993. \
                    Most of the new series used Swiss licensed movements from ETA, RONDA or ISA. Older models also use citizen and Seiko movements, \
                    like the Citizen OS10 and the famous Seiko 7T32. \n \n" +

            "In February 1999 Worldwide Brands Inc. decided the image of the Camel Trophy was no longer compatible with their targeted consumer \
                    group and cancelled their sponsoring. So after 18 years, the Camel Trophy was Finished, and the Camel Trophy watch stopped production.  \n" +
            "The Camel Trophy licence went to Japan and was changed to Camel Active. \n \n" +

            "After being bought by Mondaine, the latest models of the brand present the requirement of construction and quality of many Swiss watches. \n" +
            "Although mostly quartz, there is still a model range with automatic movements. \n" +

            "For these reasons and being a brand currently lacking, the demand for these watches has increased over the last few years. \n \n" +
