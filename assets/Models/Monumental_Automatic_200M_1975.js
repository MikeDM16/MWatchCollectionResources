        text: "After some research in the most common watch forums, like WatchUSeek or TimeZone, no solid information can be found regarding the \
         origins and history of the Monumental watch brand. \n \n" +

            "Some models appear at eBay auctions and based on their style, Monumental seems to be a Swiss-based watch brand, assembling their models around the \
         1960s and until mid-1970s. \n \n" +

            "As usual back then, Monumental shared cases and movements whit and from others brands. By searching for timepieces whit the same movement and dive features,\
         easily poped-up a brand whit the same dial, movement and case, but having as the brand name \"Vanguard\". \n \n" +

            "The model can be found whit or without the bezel. The non-bezel versions have a very thick glass, mostly due to the \"super-waterproof\" feature of the watch.\n" +

            "After seeing that even the serial number on the back-case is the same in shared models between  Monumental and Vanguard brand, maybe the two brands were deeply related. \
        Looking at the diving depth that the watch claims to hold and the high quality ETA movement, Monumental brand should have produced mid-level watches for their market.",
