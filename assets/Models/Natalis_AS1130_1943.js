        text:"Natalis is a vintage watch brand which appears to have their major sales around the 1930s and 1940s. \n"+
        "From the few information that I was able to gather, there also seems to be a strong connection between the brand and Germany, \
        although some high-end model have the \"Swiss Made\" stamp in the dials. \n \n"+

        "Models that sometimes appear at online sales and forums, are essentially military and pilot watches, using simple designs in the dials and very lume, \
         allowing a fast reading low light and tactical conditions. There is, however, also some very good dress watches and high-end models, having as movement variants \
          of the well know Valjoux.\n \n"+

        "This particular model is one of the non-military and more daily formal watches that the brand assembled back then. \
        Given their age, it's in some rough condition. \n"+
        "The case seems to be chromed nickel and has some severe marks and scratches, which for me actually gives it a very particular look. \
        The build quality is also not the most rigorous, as the length between the lug ends is not the same on both sides of the case. \
        This could be explained because of around 1943, the Germans were hard pressed for cash and they were supplied with less costly watches, \
         but yet build rugged and dependable. \n \n"+
        
        "The acrylic glass dome could be easily removed. Although I rather don't risk any tries regards the cleaning of the dial, which as started to become\
         greyish due to the decades.\n"+
         
        "The movement is fully working and without losing time, after some cleaning and lubrification of the parts. \
        It is based on the AS 1130 although this version seems to be a bit more detailed. It was also used in some \
        prestigious brand, as for instance the caliber Girard-Perregaux 27 or the Alpina 652. \n"+
        
        "This movement is known as the Wehrmachtswerk, which translates to \"army movement\", as it was deeply used in German military watches back then.\n \n"+
        
        "Following the end of WW1 and the Peace Treaty of Versailles in 1919, German was forced to limit the number of German troops to 100,000 and \
        was strictly prohibited to use of any aircrafts. Even German planes that survived WW1 were dismantled. \n"+
        "In the following 15 years and until around 1930’s there was no German air force, which, during the German Nazi time was called \"Luftwaffe\". \n"+
        
        "This is an important historical information since this context meant that there were literally no military-issued watches in Germany during that important period. \
        Many companies, either less known brands like Natalis to powerhouses like Omega and Breitling did issue aviator watches but none were officially military marked. \n"+

        "Although, there were many pilot's watches that were distributed to and worn by pilots in the Luftwaffe (German Nazi Airforce). \
        This information was taken from Konrad Knirim’s “Militäruhren” (Military Timepieces), 2002, page 146. \
        The last two photos were also taken from this book, where there can be seen that the brand Natalis appear together whit other big names \
         like Mimo, Breitling, Titus, Zenith, Omega and Helvetia. Also, other manufacturers such as Longines, Roamer and Lanco made this type of military watches \
          around the 1930s.",
