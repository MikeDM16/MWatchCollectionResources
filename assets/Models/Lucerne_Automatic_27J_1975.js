        text: "Lucerne watches have their major appearance in the 1970s. \n" +
            "The brand name is the same as a city in central Switzerland, therefore possibly justifying the brand \"Swiss made\" origins and establishing. \n \n" +

            "Their models were essentially simple timepieces, built with a low production cost and taking advantage of the \"Swiss Made\" high-quality philosophy to\
         make their prices up. Still, the brand was reliable and provided rather affordable watches for their time. \n \n" +

            "The watches could use simple pin-lever movements up to decent jewelled calibers. If there is any information in the dial or in the movement engraving \
         regarding the jewels numbers, then the movement does have jewels. Otherwise, it's probably a pin-lever movement. ",
